# NASA-Space-Apps-Challenge

The Implicit Association Test (IAT, developed by Harvard University’s Project Implicit) measures the strength of association between two concepts, particularly attitudes and beliefs that people may be unwilling to report. 
This adaptation of the IAT is a Citizen Science project that implicitly determines the individual’s attitudes about space explorations’ association with gender and seeks to provide small interventions to positively change biased associations. The IAT uses images of space discovery/technology videos and images of astronauts readily available through CSA/NASA Open Science Image and Multimedia Centre. After completing the test, participants then measurably examine whether their own attitudes have changed after watching selected NASA/CSA Open Science videos. In addition to recognizing individual biases and providing individuals the opportunity to grow and learn further, this Project also helps NASA/CSA identify which kind of initiatives could increase the positive effect the most.
